[Quine](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Quine) is a type of program that can output its own source code.

The quine version of DB Monitor will print its complete code of itself before the main part of program is running. Experience this kind of fun!

(P.S A python source file of DB Monitor should run with a Windows 7 or 10 operating system, a python environment whose version is greater than 3.7, all requirements listed in README.md and icon.ico and setting.json in the same path.)
